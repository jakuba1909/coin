cd src/
make -f makefile.unix            +ACM- Headless monkey

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building monkey QT,
the graphical monkey.

Dependencies

 Library     Purpose           Description
 -------     -------           -----------
 libssl      SSL Support       Secure communications
 libdb       Berkeley DB       Blockchain +ACY- wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support
 libqrencode QRCode generation Optional QRCode generation

Note that libexecinfo should be installed, if you building under +ACo-BSD systems.
This library provides backtrace facility.

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE+AF8-UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE+AF8-UPNP+AD0--    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE+AF8-UPNP+AD0-0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE+AF8-UPNP+AD0-1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

libqrencode may be used for QRCode image generation. It can be downloaded
from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via
your package manager. Set USE+AF8-QRCODE to control this:
 USE+AF8-QRCODE+AD0-0   (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required
 USE+AF8-QRCODE+AD0-1   QRCode support enabled
